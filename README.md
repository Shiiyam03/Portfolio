# Description
A personal portfolio website is like your online showcase or resume. It's a website where you can share information about yourself, your skills, education, and work experience. It often includes examples of your work, such as projects or achievements, and may have a section for your contact information. The goal is to give visitors a clear and compelling overview of who you are professionally and what you can do. It's a way for you to present your skills and accomplishments to potential employers, clients, or anyone interested in learning more about you.
